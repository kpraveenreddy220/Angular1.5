List of Commands entered:
NOTES: sometimes you dont see updated files in your node_modules, you have to press f5 on whole project to see changes)

1. npm install angular     			(installs angularjs)
**notes**
- the above npm install angular command just installs angularjs in to your node_modues folder. 
- In order to update angular to package.json also(i.e. to add to dev_dependencies) we use following command:
  
  npm install angular -D
  
  npm install routes -D             (to add routing run this command, you can see routes directory in node_modules after this command runs successfully). 
  
 NOTE: i am running above commands from my end so that package.json updated accordingly, you dont have to run them again. 

2. npm install -g http-server 		(http-server is a simple, zero-configuration command-line http server. 
									 It is powerful enough for production usage, but it's simple and hackable enough to be used for testing, 
								 	local development, and learning.)
3. http-server -o					(to start a server). It should open a index page in browser.
